	<strong>Normal: 1 Point</strong><br>
	<strong>Light: 2 Points </strong><br>
	<strong>Excessive: 0 Points</strong><br>
	<strong>Skip: NEGATIVE 1 Point (Don’t skip meals – it’s not healthy.)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	What’s “normal”? A meal with about 1/3 of your daily requirement for calories and daily recommended nutrients.
</p>
<p>
	Light: About 1/4 of your daily calories requirement, but still with some of your daily recommended nutrients. Low-fat and low-calorie choices are usually part of a light meal.
</p>
<p>
	Excessive: More than 1/3 of your daily calories requirement.
</p>
<p>
	Since dinner is usually the last big meal of the day, good choices can help balance out your nutrition goals for the day.
</p>
<p>
	Get the recommended amount of daily fiber. <em>Fiber slows the digestive process so that you feel fuller for a longer period of time</em> (and will be less likely to crave food between meals).
</p>
<p>
    Each serving of fruits and veggies is one point!
