	<strong>Normal: 1 Point</strong><br>
	<strong>Light: 2 Points </strong><br>
	<strong>Excessive: 0 Points</strong><br>
	<strong>Skip: NEGATIVE 1 Point (Don’t skip meals – it’s not healthy.)</strong>
</p>
<p>
	What’s “normal”? A meal with about 1/3 of your daily requirement for calories and daily recommended nutrients.
</p>
<p>
	Light: About 1/4 of your daily calories requirement, but still with some of your daily recommended nutrients. Low-fat and low-calorie choices are usually part of a light meal.
</p>
<p>
	Excessive: More than 1/3 of your daily calories requirement.
</p>
<p>
	Many nutritionists feel breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  A healthy breakfast gives you a good start on the day and gives you more flexibility in your meal and beverage choices the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
	A healthy breakfast should include fiber and protein. (Most people only get about 20% of their daily protein at breakfast - shoot for more than that.)  <em>Fiber slows the digestive process so that you feel fuller for a longer period of time</em> (and will be less likely to crave food between meals).
</p>
<p>
	Fruits and veggies should always be part of a meal, but count them separately in DietWZ. <em>Each serving is one point</em>!
</p>
<p>
	Drink a of glass water BEFORE you eat. It makes you feel fuller and aids digestion.
