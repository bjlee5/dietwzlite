  <p> Dinner in a Mexican Restaurant can be a <em>calorie fiesta</em>, but if you read the menu carefully you can find plenty of healthy options that are low in
    fat and nutritious. <em>Avoid dishes that are fried or loaded with cheese and sour cream.</em> </p>
  <p> Many Mexican restaurants greet patrons with a basket of <u>tortilla chips, salsa and the margarita drink menu</u>. Just 12 chips and a little salsa are
    about 300 to 350 calories. Margaritas can range from 170 calories (small, 4 oz., on the rocks) to more than 500 calories for a big (10 oz.), sugary, slushy
    drink. Think about your overall calories goal for the meal . . . </p>
  <p> Look for meats and seafood that are <em>grilled and combined with tomatoes, onions, peppers and other vegetables.</em> Avoid dishes where the shrimp or
    other seafood ingredients are battered and fried. </p>
  <p> Stews and casseroles made with <u>chorizo</u> (a spicy pork sausage) are fine as long as cheese and sour cream are limited. </p>
