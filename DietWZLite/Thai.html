  <p> Good Choices: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Hot and sour shrimp soup</u> which is broth based (but a bit high in sodium) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Fresh <u>vegetable spring rolls</u>, which are steamed </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Use <u>two tablespoons or fewer of sweet and sour sauce</u> - low in calories, but high in sodium </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Som Tum</u> salad with green papaya </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Satay</u> skewers, which are grilled. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Num Tok</u> marinated grilled beef over greens </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Cashew chicken</u> for lean protein and healthy fats from the cashews. Eat a reasonable serving and take home leftovers. For a little more fiber, order with <u>brown rice</u> instead of steamed white rice. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Pad Thai</u> and other stir-fry dishes - healthy because they use fresh vegetables, noodles, lean proteins and no coconut milk, but easy to over-eat because of portion sizes.  Take some home! </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Pik Pow dishes</u> which have lean protein like shrimp or squid and vegetables. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Pra Ram Long Song</u> chicken breast with steamed vegetables. Ask for the peanut sauce on the side. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Fruit ice</u> for dessert (mixed fruit in syrup with ice) </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> Avoid: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Coconut milk</u> - which has 400 calories and 50 grams of saturated fat per cup.  Curries are often made with coconut milk. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Sauces that are <u>high in sodium</u>, and most used in Thai dishes are.  Keep this in mind as you look at your sodium intake for the day. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Items that are <u>deep fried</u> or covered with <u>greasy or oily sauces</u> </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Coconut shrimp soup</u>, which has lots of saturated fat.  Hot and sour soup is a better choice. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Fried spring rolls</u> </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Coconut ice cream</u> </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
