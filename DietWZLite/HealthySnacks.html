  <p> <strong>Each serving = 1 point</strong> </p>
  <p> Nearly everyone likes to snack, but snacks can destroy your diet success - particularly if you’re trying to lose weight. However, <em>snacks don’t have to be unhealthy</em>. </p>
  <p> A <em>healthy snack</em> is generally one which:
  <ul>
    <li> Has some nutrition value (and contributes to your overall nutrition objectives) </li>
    <li> Is low-fat </li>
    <li> Is low-sugar </li>
    <li> Is moderate in carbohydrates (carbs) </li>
    <li> Doesn’t push you over your daily calories intake objective </li>
    <li> Helps you make it to the next meal without additional snacking </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p> Check out the DietWZ <em>Database of Healthy Food and Beverage Ideas (via “Info”)</em> when you need help with a snack choice. </p>
  <p> Tip: <em>Make sure healthy snacks are easy to see in your kitchen and your home.</em> (Hide the unhealthy ones.) When looking for a snack, most people will choose one of the first things they see. </p>
  <p> Your body needs carbohydrates as a source of energy, but too many carbs is unhealthy. The DGA recommends you keep your daily carbs intake in the range of 45 to 55% of your daily total calories intake. And, go for healthy carb sources, such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans. </p>
