    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes/No question.</strong>  (Example: Took Vitamin D today?)
            </li>
        <li><st>Counter.</strong>  (Example: Cups of coffee:)
            </li>
        <li><strong>Numeric entry.</strong>  (Example: Added sugar for the day:)
            </li>
     </ul>
    <p>To set up something to track, you need to enter the text for that item.</p>
    <p>For a counter, you can select a maximum value (or just leave the default value, 99).</p>
    <p>For a numeric entry, you can select how many decimal places you want to the right of the decimal point.
    </p>
