  <p> <strong>Each serving = NEGATIVE 1 point</strong> </p>
  <p> Your body needs carbohydrates as a source of energy, <em>but too many carbs is unhealthy.</em> The DGA recommends you keep your daily carbs intake in the range of 45 to 55% of your daily total calories intake. <em>And, go for healthy carb sources that include other important nutrients, such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans.</em> </p>
  <p> You can treat yourself to an unhealthy carbs choice once in a while â€“ but limit this behavior. <em>(And keep the unhealthy snacks out-of-sight!)</em> </p>
  <p> Examples of things to avoid include:
  
  <ul>
    <li> Pastries, donuts, cake, cookies </li>
    <li> White (refined) bread </li>
    <li> White rice </li>
    <li> Sugar and added sugars (like high-fructose corn syrup) </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p> Total carbohydrates on a nutrition label is often the total of sugars, fiber and other carbohydrates. Read food labels to help control your carbs. </p>
  <p> <strong>Each gram of carbs is 4 calories.</strong> </p>
