  <p> American cuisine is a blend of many cultures adapted to foods found, grown and produced in the United States.  Americans have many options when it comes to choosing what to eat. <em>Unfortunately, people don’t always make the best choices and often eat too much.</em> </p>
  <span style=color:#008000> <!-- Green -->
  <p> Good Choices: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> Fresh fruit </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Fresh vegetables, raw or lightly cooked, served <em>without loads of butter or high-fat sauces</em>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Lean steaks, chops and poultry served <em>grilled or baked</em>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Whole-grain</em> cereals, breads and pasta. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Fish and seafood (aim for two meals per week) <em>served grilled, baked or poached with herbs and light sauces</em>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, ice cream and other diary products. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> Avoid: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Deep-fried food</em>.  In America, if it's edible, someone has tried to deep fry it.  Stay away from deep-fried turkey, hot dogs, candy bars, cookies and any other "county fair" food. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Creamy, high-fat</em> salad dressings that contain mayonnaise. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>High-fat meats</em> such as pork spare ribs or meats served with rich sauces. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </span>
  <p> Here are some popular American dishes and suggestions for making them healthier choices: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Apple pie</em>: Serve without ice cream, whipped cream or cheddar cheese.  Eat only part of the pie crust.  Alternatives are apple crisp or a fresh raw apple. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich</em>: Use turkey bacon and low-fat mayonnaise, and ask for it served on whole-wheat bread. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Barbecued pork ribs</em> : Substitute pulled pork with fat removed. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Brownies</em> : Choose a small piece of chocolate or a small chocolate chip cookie. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Chili</em> : Avoid toppings such as cheese, sour cream and corn chips. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Corn dog</em> : Skip the deep-fried, county fair food and choose a beef or turkey hot dog on a bun. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Deep-fried food</em> : Choose items that are grilled, baked or lightly cooked in oil. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Doughnut</em> : Choose a small “doughnut hole.” </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>French fries</em> : Substitute baked or boiled potatoes. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Fried chicken</em> : Ask for grilled or baked. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Hamburger; Cheeseburger</em> : Forget calorie-laden toppings such as special sauces, bacon, extra cheese, etc. Choose plain burgers with vegetables like lettuce, onions, tomatoes or pickles.  If you really want cheese, use a thin slice or sprinkle with shredded cheese. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Macaroni and Cheese</em> : Choose it as a small side dish or substitute hot pasta tossed with olive oil and garlic, and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Add cooked vegetables to increase the nutrition. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Pumpkin pie</em> : Skip the whipped topping. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Reuben sandwich</em> : Substitute turkey for the corned beef, sweet pickle relish for the Thousand Island dressing and ask for a thin slice of cheese. Ask that it be
        toasted without butter. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <em>Tuna fish sandwich or melt</em> : Ask for whole-wheat bread and low-fat mayonnaise. On the melt, skip the cheese or ask that only a thin slice be used. </p>
    </li>
    <p>
    <li> <em>Wedge salad</em> : Substitute a small, green mixed vegetable salad with dressing on the side and no croutons or bacon.
      </p>
