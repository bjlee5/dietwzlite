  <p> <strong>Daily Exercise = 1 point</strong> </p>
  <p> Daily exercise is good for everyone! Just 20 to 30 minutes of exercise per day provides overall health benefits. </p>
  <p> If you’re physically able, get out there and try for 30 minutes of exercise every day. If you have physical limitations or are overweight or obese, work with your doctor or a trainer to get started slowly. </p>
  <p> For people trying to lose weight, some experts recommend daily exercise that burns 300 calories in 30 to 45 minutes. </p>
  <p> It takes protein to maintain and build muscle. <em>Normally, protein intake should be between 0.8 and 1.0 g per kg of body weight</em>. 0.8 is a good general target.  The "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture. 2015 – 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 8th Edition, December 2015" recommends<br>
    <strong>46 g daily for adult females<br>
    56 g for adult males.</strong> </p>
  <p> However, if you’re very active physically, you’ll need more protein. This is a good reason to <em>consult a registered dietitian (RD or RDN) or your doctor</em>, as physical activity can increase your daily needs to a range of 1.0 to 1.4 g per kg body weight for recreational athletes, and as high as 1.7 for endurance athletes or someone doing regular strength training. </p>
  <p> Also, if you're obese (BMI 30 or higher) and are trying to lose weight, you should consult your doctor or a registered dietitian about possibly increasing your protein intake.  Some studies show that increased protein in your diet can help satisfy your appetite. </p>
