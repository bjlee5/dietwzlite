<p>Make healthy food and beverage choices and get some exercise over each 2-day cycle to score points!</p>
<p>There's no hard rule about how many points to score -- YOU decide what your points goal should be, based on your objectives.</p>

<p>For example, a <em>healthy eating and exercise score</em> over a 2-day cycle might be in the range of <strong>16 points or more</strong>  -- based on normal meals, daily exercise, and 4 to 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day.</p>

<p>Details of the points associated with your choices are shown for each day in a 2-day cycle.</p>
<p>The past 15 2-day cycles are also shown.</p>

<p>The <strong>More History</strong> selection provides additional graphs showing how you've been doing with your choices in each category for the past 30 days.  AND, you can see the history of your custom categories.</p>

<p>You can use the graphs to see trends in your eating habits and spot areas where you might be able to improve! </p>
