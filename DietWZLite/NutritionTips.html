        There are many sources of nutrition information, including the <a href="https://www.dietwz.com" target="_blank">DietWZ website.</a> The best source of information is a <em>registered dietitian (with the letters RD or RDN after his or her name) or your doctor,</em> but some helpful, educational tips are included here.  The <em>USDA/USDHHS 2015 - 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 8th Edition. December 2015</em> (referred to as the DGA) is the source of some of the following information.  App users should consult their doctor or a registered dietitian before making dietary changes.

        Here's a bullet point summary of the key objectives <em>for a person in normal health,</em> but please read further for more details on each:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                <em>Sodium:</em> DGA recommendation is <strong>less than 2,300 mg per day.</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <em>Sugar:</em>  Based on World Health Organization guidelines, <strong>limit your daily free sugars intake to 5 to 10% of your total calories (energy) intake.  The DGA recommends keeping added sugar below 10% of your daily calories intake.</strong>  (Sugar is 4 calories per gram.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <em> Saturated fat:</em> Try to limit saturated fat intake to <strong>not more than 10% of your daily calories,</strong> per the DGA.  (Fat is 9 calories per gram.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <em> Fiber:</em> <strong>Females: 22 to 28 g daily.<br>Males: 28 to 34 g daily. </strong><br> (Lower the amount as you age.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <em>Protein:</em> Normally, daily protein intake should be <strong>between 0.8 and 1.0 g per kg of body weight</strong>. <br>DGA recommends:<br> <strong>46 g protein daily for adult females,<br>52 to 56 g for adult males.</strong>
                </p>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <em>Carbohydrates:</em>  Try to get most of your “carbs”) from healthy sources: whole grains, beans, and fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables.<br> Try to keep your daily carbs intake in the range of <strong>45 to 55% of your daily total calories intake.</strong>
                    </p>
                </li>
                
                <h3>More Info</h3>
                <p>IF you have high blood pressure (hypertension), you may need to <em>further reduce your daily sodium intake to less than 1,500 mg.  Follow your doctor's orders!</em>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Limit consumption of added sugar, <em>since excess consumption can lead to weight gain and Type 2 diabetes.</em>  For example, if your goal for daily calories intake, is 1,800 calories, a 10% goal for added sugar intake should be not more than 180 calories (about 45 grams). Each gram of sugar is 4 calories, and a teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams (16 calories).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <em>Soluble fiber</em> slows the release of food from your stomach to your intestines, so you <em>feel fuller longer</em>. Insoluble fiber is good for <em>digestive health and weight control</em>.

                It takes protein to maintain and build muscle.  If you’re very active physically, you’ll need more protein. This is a good reason to <em>consult a registered dietitian or your doctor</em>, as physical activity can increase your daily needs to a range of 1.0 to 1.4 g per kg body weight for recreational athletes, and as high as 1.7 for endurance athletes or regular strength training.
                </p>
                <p>
                Also, if you're obese (BMI 30 or higher) and are trying to lose weight, you should consult your doctor or a registered dietitian about possibly increasing your protein intake.  Some studies show that increased protein in your diet can help satisfy your appetite.

                <h3>More Tips</h3>
                
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <em>Protein</em>
                    is found in meats, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, soy products, nuts and seeds. These foods contribute B vitamins, zinc, magnesium and iron to your
                    diet.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    Fill 1/2 of your plate with fruits and veggies, 1/4 with protein, 1/4 with whole grains.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    Try to consume <em>half (or more) of your grains as whole grain</em>. “Whole grain” means the product contains the <em>whole grain seed</em> – and its
                    nutrients and fiber. Examples: whole-grain breads, crackers and cereals, oatmeal, brown rice.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    Drink a glass of water before meals. <em>Water helps you feel fuller and it aids digestion</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    And, <em>you need to stay hydrated to stay healthy</em>.  Generally, you're fluid intake is probably adequate if you are seldom thirsty and your urine is colorless or light yellow.  If you have a medical condition or just aren't sure what your fluid intake should be, consult your doctor or a registered dietitian.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    <em>Milk and milk products</em> are good sources of calcium, Vitamin D and potassium. (But, they can also have fat and sodium – choose wisely!) Go with fat-free (skim) milk or 1% milk instead of whole milk or 2% for lower fat intake and fewer calories.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
