	Although Italian restaurant menus often contain dishes that are lavished with cheese and high-calorie sauces served in huge portions, there are many
	healthy alternatives in Italian cuisine. Olive oil, tomatoes, garlic, spinach, radicchio, figs, peppers and beans are among the good-for-you ingredients
	found in Italian dishes.

		<p>
Avoid:
		</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<u>Antipasto</u> - a selection of meats, cheeses, olives and marinated vegetables that is high in sodium and can fill you up before the main course arrives
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Any dish that says <u>Alfredo or carbonara</u> (creamy, high-fat sauces loaded with calories)
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<u>Parmigiana</u> dishes, which are breaded, fried and topped with cheese
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<u>Lasagna</u> has layers of heavy cheese and creamy sauce with lots of fat and calories
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<u>Fried ravioli</u> - too many calories
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			When ordering pizza, <u>cut calories by choosing thin crusts, mostly vegetable toppings and a minimum of cheese. Limit your servings</u>. <u>Calzones</u>
			are simply pizza crust and fillings folded to make a turnover, so the same rules apply.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<u>Gorgonzola cheese sauce</u> - very rich
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<u>Bread sticks and garlic bread slices slathered with butter</u> and buried under a layer of cheese. Better choice: plain Italian bread dipped in a small amount of flavored olive oil.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Desserts like <u>tiramisu, panna cotta and cannoli</u>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
