<p>
	Everyday life is full of roadblocks to good health and weight control.  DietWZ is a tool to track your pattern of choices to help you <em>learn to make healthier choices</em>.  And, DietWZ contains plenty of educational tips on nutrition and healthy eating.  Good health is all about making good choices.
</p>
<p>
	Since DietWZ tracks your choices and the points you earn over <em>successive 2-day cycles</em>, you have a chance to eat better tomorrow if you didn't do so well today. (Or, if you know you won't have good control over your diet tomorrow, you might make better choices today!)
</p>
