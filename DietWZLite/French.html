    </li>

      <p> Although <u>Coquilles St. Jacques</u> contains scallops in cream sauce with cheese, the portions served are usually small (appetizer size) so this is a
        good choice if you want a taste of a French sauce with your dinner. </p>

      <p> <u>Haricot verts</u> - lightly buttered young French green beans </p>
    </li>
