  <p> <strong>Each serving = NEGATIVE 1 point</strong> </p>
  <p> Sugary drinks are <em>sweetened with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup,</em> with few other nutrients. Soft drinks, fruit drinks, fruit smoothies and lemonade are examples. </p>
  <p> Better alternatives: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Water! </li>
    <li> Low-fat milk </li>
    <li> Unsweetened coffee or tea </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Limit consumption of sugary drinks on a regular basis, since regular consumption can lead to weight gain and Type 2 diabetes.  A healthy target, based on World Health Organization guidelines, is to <em>limit your daily added (or "free") sugar intake to 5 to 10% of your total calories (energy) intake.</em> So, for example, if your goal for daily calories intake, is 1,800 calories, your added sugar intake should be not more than 90 to 180 calories (23 to 46 grams). </p>
  <p> <strong>Each gram of sugar is 4 calories, and a teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams (16 calories).</strong> </p>
  <p> Read food labels to help control your sugar intake. The USDA Nutrition Facts label provides the total amount of sugars (natural and added), <em>but does not list added sugars separately</em> (this will change in the future). </p>
  <p> Natural sugars are found mainly in fruit and milk products. </p>
