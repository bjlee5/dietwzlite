  <p> <strong>Normal: 1 Point</strong><br>
    <strong>Light: 2 Points </strong><br>
    <strong>Excessive: 0 Points</strong><br>
    <strong>Skip: NEGATIVE 1 Point (Don’t skip meals – it’s not healthy.)</strong> </p>
  <p> What’s normal? A meal with about 1/3 of your daily requirement for calories and daily recommended nutrients. </p>
  <p> Light: About 1/4 of your daily calories requirement, but still with some of your daily recommended nutrients. Low-fat and low-calorie choices are usually part of a light meal. </p>
  <p> Excessive: More than 1/3 of your daily calories requirement. </p>
  <p> Think about your overall diet at mid-day and make choices appropriately. If your day looks like it will be low physical activity OR if you had an excessive breakfast – have a light lunch! </p>
  <p> Add some fruits or veggies to your lunch.  Each serving is one point! </p>
  <p> Don't have an idea of your daily calories objective?  The BEST source for nutrition information is a <em>registered dietitian or your physician</em>. If you can’t do that, check out the <a href="https://www.dietwz.com" target="_blank">DietWZ website.</a> </p>
