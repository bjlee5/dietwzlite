  <p> Good Choices: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> Look for these words to make smart choices: <u>Zheng</u> – steamed. <u>Jum</u> – poached. <u>Kao</u> - roasted. <u>Shao</u> - barbecued (except
        high-fat, high-sugar spare ribs) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Soups such as <u>wonton and egg drop</u> - lower in calories than other appetizers. (However, they are high in sodium.) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Steamed spring rolls or vegetable dumplings</u>. Healthier choice than egg rolls, which are fried. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Go for steamed rice rather than fried</u>.  Brown rice has more fiber than white rice, but they're about the same in calories. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Lean beef, chicken, tofu, fish and seafood that is <u>steamed, poached, broiled or grilled</u> </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Dishes that contain lots of vegetables in light sauces. "Buddha's Delight" is an example: low calories, steamed tofu and vegetables. Other examples: Moo Goo Gai Pan and shrimp with lobster sauce. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> Avoid: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Fried appetizers</u> like dumplings and egg rolls.  An order of dumplings could be 500 calories or more. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Lo mein. chow fun and chow mein</u> - fried noodle dishes high in calories (800 calories or more) and sodium </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>General Tso's Chicken, sesame chicken, lemon chicken, and sweet and sour chicken or pork</u> - main dishes that are deep-fried with battered meat and served with high-calorie sauces. <em>Not unusual to get 1,200 calories or more from one of these choices.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Crab Rangoon</u> - breaded and deep-fried with a sugary sauce, plus cream cheese. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
