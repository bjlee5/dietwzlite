  <p> Good Choices: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Bulgogi</u>, barbecued beef served in lettuce leaves and topped with rice and kimchi.  Skip the dipping sauces which may have lots of sodium. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Korean BBQ</u> - go for seafood, chicken or short ribs rather than pork belly (samgyeopsal) which has lots of fat.  Go easy on the sauces, which usually have lots of sugar. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Mandoo guk</u> - beef stew </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Galbi or (kalbi)</u> - beef or pork short (flanken-style) ribs </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Panchan</u> (or <u>banchan</u>) - assorted small plates such as kimchi and other sides, served with rice.  For more fiber, ask for brown rice rather than white rice. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Kimchi</u> (or <u>kimchee</u>) - popular pickled vegetables dish that is low in calories. There are many combinations of vegetables, and the flavor can range from mild to very spicy. As with many pickled dishes, sodium levels are high, however, so factor this into your daily diet choices. </p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Bibimbap</u>, a rice-laden, casserole-style dish.  Ask that the rice be served on the side. Bibimbap means "mixed rice." </p>
