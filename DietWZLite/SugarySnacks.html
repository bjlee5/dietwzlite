  <p> OK, maybe you don’t want to completely deprive yourself of sweet snacks – or you may overeat to make up for it. If you really want sweets, try to limit yourself to one small sugary/sweet snack per day (or every other day). <em> And, keep the sweet snacks out-of-sight!</em> </p>
  <p> Also, limit your intake of foods with added sugars. Examples of things to avoid include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Super-sized soft drinks (sodas) </li>
    <li> Energy and sports drinks with added sugar </li>
    <li> Over-sized candy bars </li>
    <li> Sugar-sweetened fruit drinks </li>
    <li> Pastries, donuts, cake, cookies </li>
    <li> Dairy-based desserts </li>
  </ul>
  <p> A healthy target, based on World Health Organization guidelines, is to <em>limit your daily added (or "free") sugar intake to 5 to 10% of your total calories (energy) intake.</em> So, for example, if your goal for daily calories intake, is 2,400 calories, your added sugar intake should be not more than 120 to 240 calories (30 to 60 grams). </p>
  <p> <strong>Each gram of sugar is 4 calories, and a teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams (16 calories).</strong> </p>
  <p> Read food labels to help control your sugar intake. The USDA Nutrition Facts label provides the total amount of sugars (natural and added), <em>but does not list added sugars separately</em> (this will change in the future). </p>
  <p> Natural sugars are found mainly in fruit and milk products. </p>
