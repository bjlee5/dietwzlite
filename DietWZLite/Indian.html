  <p> Good Choices: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Tandoori</u> - items made in a traditional clay oven called a tandoor. Tandoori chicken or shrimp are low in fat and calories. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Vegetarian dishes</u> such as <u>dal</u>, made with lentils, and <u>chole</u>, made with chick peas, are low in oil and butter. These legumes are high in fiber and protein.  Dai Bukhara and Pindi Chole are example of these dishes. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Chicken Tikka with rice</u> instead of Chicken Korma which includes cream and coconut. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Kebab</u> dishes are grilled, such as Prawn Kebab and Barrah (lamb) Kebab. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Roti</u> - a whole-wheat bread </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Lentil</u> soup </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Low-fat plain yogurt</u> is a good option to cool a curry that's too spicy for your taste. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> Avoid: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Paneer, ghee or malai</u>. Paneers are cheeses, ghee is buttery and malai dishes use cream.  Makhani dishes use ghee.  Naan may also be brushed with ghee. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Naan</u> - a traditional bread served with Indian meals, is delicious but low in nutrition.  (Hard to resist - limit how much you eat.) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Deep-fried samosas </u> - triangular pastries filled with vegetables, meat or a combination of both </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Pakoda or Pakora</u> which is fried with tempura batter </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Limit rice.</u> One cup of basmati rice contains about 200 calories.  For some fiber, go with brown rice instead. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
