  <p><strong>Each serving = 1 point</strong> (whether part of a meal or separate) </p>
  <p><em>A minimum of 2 servings are recommended each day.</em></p>
  <p> <strong>Single serving examples:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1 cup raw fruit</strong> </li>
    <li><strong>1/2 cup dried fruit</strong> </li>
    <li><strong>1 cup 100% fruit juice</strong> </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p> Fruit should always be part of a meal. Eat a variety of fruits – <em>not just one or two types.</em> </p>
  <p> Go for fresh, frozen, canned (with no added sugar) or dried fruit. </p>
  <p> Fruits such as apples, pears, peaches, plums and grapes have more fiber if you eat the peels. <em>Whole fruits have more fiber than juices.</em> </p>
  <p> Fruits and fruit products are good sources of fiber, potassium and magnesium. </p>
  <p> Avoid fruits in light or heavy syrups – they add sugar and calories. Go for unsweetened fruits in natural juices. Look for 100% fruit juice. </p>
  <p>Eat fruits:
  <ul>
    <li>As snacks or desserts</li>
    <li>In salads</li>
    <li>In place of sugars, syrups or other sweet toppings</li>
  </ul>
