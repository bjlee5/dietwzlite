  <p> Whether it’s an upscale restaurant or a fast-food place, two of the biggest challenges with restaurant selections are that the <u>portions are too large and they contain too much sodium</u>.  In addition, meals are often centered on a large piece of meat, such as a steak, and a starchy side dish such as potatoes, noodles or rice. </p>
  <p> To make healthier restaurant choices: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Choose small or medium portions</u> for main dishes, side dishes and appetizers. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Choose entrées where meat doesn’t overwhelm the plate and is <u>balanced with vegetables and other ingredients</u>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Soups (broth-based), stews and
        casseroles (not loaded with cheese) are well-balanced options. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Select vegetables and salads over potatoes and pastas</u> when there is a choice of side dishes. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Order an appetizer or a side dish for your main course</u> instead of an entrée. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Choose foods prepared with flavorful herbs and spices, and don't add salt at the table. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Share a main dish</u> with a dining companion. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Order from the menu</u> instead of heading to the all-you-can-eat buffet. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Ignore the “clean-plate club” rule - when you’ve eaten enough, <u>leave the rest</u>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> <u>Take leftovers home</u> in a “doggy bag” -- if you can chill the food right away. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Ask that foods be prepared <u>without adding salt</u>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Order <u>salad dressings</u> "on-the-side" so that YOU control the amount you consume. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Ask for <u>whole-grain</u> breads, cereals and pastas.  Try some new grains such as quinoa, barley and amaranth. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
